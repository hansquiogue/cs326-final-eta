#### **Inovative Idea**

There are a lot of available online character creation sheets, but most of them are complicated and complex to work with and often missing key features. And often times, most players of Dungeons & Dragons when creating character creation sheets end up using the physical PDF and most people that play Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) don't even know that these character creation websites exist. That is why we are creating this project. The goal is to create a website that lets users initialize their stats, backgrounds, and skill points inside a virtual character creation sheet and have that website do some basic arithmetic and essentially keep the users character stats in a nicely packaged space. Overall, the idea of this project is to not make something super innovated, but rather to create a product that will be convenient to a very niche group of individual to overall create an innovative yet simple product for those who love D&D.

### **Important Components**

The main functionality of our application is to take in various user inputs from a DnD character sheet and automatically output back the calculated statistics and values. For example, an input could be an image the user wants their character to look like. Another example could be skills the user wants to add to their character, and our application would automatically perform the calculations to update those skills. Our application will also have a dice roller a user could use.
