## **Project Euryale**

### *Online Dungeons & Dragons (DnD) Character Sheet Tool*

Because our project effectively is built around the idea of the user editing a document, which we were already representing in large objects, we decided that MongoDB would be more suited to our implementation.

This resulted in two collections with which out website data may be stored, `users` and `characters`, as defined in *[collections-definitions.md](collections-definitions.md)*

- Character sheet front+back end

**John:**

- 404 page/register successful front+back end

## Notes

We've created an example account with these credentials:

- **username:** grading

- **password:** grading

This account is loaded with an example character, to see how this webapp might be used.
