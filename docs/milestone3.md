## **Project Euryale**

### *Online Dungeons & Dragons (DnD) Character Sheet Tool*

---

Because our project effectively is built around the idea of the user editing a document, which we were already representing in large objects, we decided that MongoDB would be more suited to our implementation.

This resulted in two collections with which out website data may be stored, `users` and `characters`, as defined in *[collections-definitions.md](collections-definitions.md)*
