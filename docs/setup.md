Note: all the files in the repository are required to build the project. Please make sure that all files are downloaded and accounted for.

#### **Download**

Our preferred method of retrieving our project is to use **git to clone** the repository. But other methods, such as [downloading a ZIP file](https://github.com/hansquiogue/cs326-final-eta/archive/master.zip) of our repository can work as well.

#### **Requirements**

-    [Node.js]( https://nodejs.org/en/)
-    [npm]( https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

#### **Building the Project**

Once all the files are downloaded and the requirements are completed, the project can finally be setup. Here are the setup steps:

1.    Change the directory to the path where you placed the Euryale repository.

2.    Install the package dependencies for Euryale.
    o    use **npm i** to install the required packages

3.    Run the server script to initialize Euryale.
    o    use **npm run start** to start the server

4.    Load the Euryale webpage.
    o    Head to **localhost:8080** on your preferred browser
    o    Make sure the ports 8080 are not blocked in your network! Otherwise, you may personally change the port in server/server.js if needed.
